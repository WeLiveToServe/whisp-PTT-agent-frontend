**KH Note 1:** Consider experimenting with a slightly larger chunk size / stride trade-off. Accept more latency if it yields a more forgiving streaming pipeline. Make it work first, optimize second.
**KH Note 2:** Confirm the Whisper-1 streaming loop behaves over longer recordings; watch for rate limits and be ready to cache prompts if the session runs past a few minutes.
# CODEX-EOD-SUNDAY

## Executive Summary
We finished the device-first split and brought real-time transcription online without relying on whisper.cpp. The device server now handles audio capture, chunking, and transcription by calling OpenAI's Whisper-1 for both the live stream and the final pass. Live segments flow straight into SQLite and back to the UI through `/api/live`, while the Browser keeps polling during a recording session so partial text appears as you speak. The backend stub remains in place for future cloud responsibilities, but all user-facing workflows run locally against the device service.

## Detailed Progress (~1000 words)
We continued the refactor that pulled recording controls out of `whisp_server_redline.py`. The new `device` package owns the FastAPI app exposed from `device_server.py`, and it now fronts every interaction the UI needs. `/api/record/start`, `/api/record/stop`, `/api/status`, `/api/chits`, `/api/live`, and the transcript export endpoints all share the same session identifiers, letting the browser treat the device server as the future on-device runtime.

Inside the recorder we kept the same streaming topology but swapped out the dependency on whisper.cpp. `RecorderService._process_window` still accumulates two second windows with a one second hop, writes each chunk to disk, and immediately sends it for transcription. The new `transcribe_live_chunk` helper in `device/transcription.py` delegates to `transcripter_redline.transcribe_whisper_file`, which wraps `client.audio.transcriptions.create(model="whisper-1", ...)`. Errors fall back to bracketed placeholders so the UI stays stable even if the network hiccups. We retained the rolling prompt logic, so each chunk carries the most recent few hundred characters to help Whisper keep context.

The final-pass transcription path continues to use `transcribe_and_enhance`, which now also calls Whisper-1 and logs raw text into `sessions/transcripts.log`. Because both live and final transcripts share the same OpenAI client, we have a single place to tighten prompts, add caching, or plug in future enhancement models without touching the recorder again.

On the data layer, `device/database.py` still manages both `ChitRecord` and `LiveSegment`. Exporting or clearing transcripts truncates both tables so the UI history and database stay aligned. Live segments gain a `finalized` flag when the stop call completes, making it straightforward to differentiate in-progress text from archived entries if we decide to build richer analytics later.

The backend stub (`backend_server.py`) remains a clean placeholder: it now sits unused during normal flows, but it gives us a safe place to hang cloud callbacks once we are ready. Because the device server owns the entire capture and transcription pipeline, we can ship to TestFlight without pulling in the backend yet.

On the front-end we wired the polling loop back up. `html_redline.html` already had the helper functions to fetch `/api/live`, render `.transcription-entry--live` elements, and clear them when a session ends. The missing piece was calling `startLivePolling()` when recording begins. Adding that single call means the UI now refreshes live text every second during a session, delivering the real-time experience we designed for.

## Decisions and Follow-ups
- Removed whisper.cpp assets and the `device/whispercpp_runner.py` helper in favour of OpenAI Whisper-1 for both streaming and final transcripts.
- Keep monitoring Whisper-1 latency during multi-minute sessions; if round-trips grow, revisit chunk size and prompt handling.
- When we are ready to target TestFlight, revisit on-device transcription options, but keep the current API contract intact so we can swap implementations behind the same interface.
