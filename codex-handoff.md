We now have a working push-to-talk transcription prototype with a terminal-styled browser UI. The Python backend (whisp_web_server.py) still relies on recorder_latest.record_push_to_talk() and Whisper transcription, exposing /api/record/start, /api/record/stop, and /api/status. It patches keyboard.is_pressed so that gestures from the web front end can drive the existing recorder loop. The server caches the last result or error so the UI can glean startup failures. Front end lives in draft-whisppt-html-v05.html; it talks to the server with fetch calls, displays each transcript entry via a typewriter animation, and tracks per-snippet and cumulative timers. We recently restyled everything to a “matrix green” dark theme with a finish button that fades the mic and reveals placeholder option buttons. Totals now accumulate only while a snippet is recording. There are still open polish items: the mic sometimes gets obscured when the log grows; the total timer should feel rock solid; we need to wire the finish options into the CLI flow; and real streaming transcription is pending. Stubs for agents (agents.py) and the CLI orchestrator (flow.py) remain untouched. requirements.txt captures the module dependencies. Sessions directory collects WAV/MP3 recordings. Next steps: stabilize UI layout, investigate duplicate snippet rendering, connect finish actions, and consider streaming chunk support.

## Modularization Vision
The codebase is ready to graduate from a single-experiment layout into a structure that mirrors how a multidisciplinary product team works. I would introduce four top-level domains. **Interface** would shelter every visual or conversational surface: the terminal-style web app, any future native wrappers, and component libraries. **Experience Services** would own request/response orchestration between front ends and back-end capabilities, exposing stable APIs while hiding device quirks. **Audio Platform** would curate hardware access, buffering, file management, and real-time streaming experiments. **Knowledge Services** would curate transcription, enhancement, and agent integrations. Each domain would live as a Python package or front-end workspace with its own tests, fixtures, and build pipelines. Shared contracts would live in a `core` package that publishes typed interfaces and domain events so teams can iterate independently.

In practice, the web bundle moves into `interface/web/`, splitting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so design systems can evolve without touching recorder logic. The bridge server becomes `experience/api/recorder_service.py`, formally depending on the audio and knowledge packages through injected interfaces. The recorder and transcription scripts become `audio/capture/` and `knowledge/transcription/`, with CLI utilities staying in `interface/cli/`. We would also add a `shared/config/` module to centralize environment loading and logging, plus a `tests/` tree that mirrors these domains. With that structure, designers ship component updates without waiting on microphone fixes, the audio team can swap in a streaming engine without breaking the contract, and product folks can experiment with new agent actions by extending the knowledge layer. The guiding principle is to let teams depend on interfaces, never on each other's internal modules, so experimentation stays fast while the product hardens.

## Current File to Module Mapping
- `whisp_web_server.py` (^^): HTTP bridge layer, recorder service integration, transcription dispatch, status caching.
- `recorder_latest.py` (@@): Device capture callbacks, push-to-talk finite loop, MP3 conversion helpers.
- `transcripter_latest.py` ($$): Whisper API wrapper, enhancement stub, transcript persistence.
- `ui.py` ({|}): CLI messaging utilities, spinner/timer output, recording status helpers.
- `draft-whisppt-html-v05.html` (~~): Browser UI, matrix theme styling, timers, client-side recorder controls.

## Updated Progress Since Prior Log
- Migrated the inline styling from `draft-whisppt-html-v05.html:1` into `assets/css/theme.css:1`, swapping the monolithic `<style>` block for a `<link>` tag so all future theme tweaks live in one CSS asset.
- Reworked the top banner in `assets/css/theme.css:44-63` to centre the Clara logo, removed the decorative separators, and tuned padding so the green pill artwork fills the header without distorting the shell.
- Enlarged the transcription panel in `assets/css/theme.css:67-102`, adding `width: calc(100% - 0.6rem)` plus an inner outline to match the latest mock while keeping timers and history visible without scrolling.
- Moved the mic controls out of the panel (`draft-whisppt-html-v05.html:21-37`) and restyled `.recording-controls`/`.mic-button` (`assets/css/theme.css:202-241`) so the button sits centred below the card, remains clickable, and no longer collides with the footer nav.
- Added duplicate guards in the browser: `renderEntry` now tags entries with `dataset.audioPath` and bails if the newest node matches (`draft-whisppt-html-v05.html:115-140`), while a `stopInFlight` flag around `/api/record/stop` prevents overlapping requests and extra DOM inserts (`draft-whisppt-html-v05.html:59,200-243`).
- Simplified navigation icons by replacing emoji with short ASCII glyphs (`PR`, `CH`, `AG`, `DM`) in `draft-whisppt-html-v05.html:26-37`, eliminating shell-side Unicode issues when launching the page.
- Removed the MP3 conversion from `recorder_latest.py:13,60-61`, letting `record_push_to_talk` return the WAV path immediately and cutting several seconds from each record/stop cycle while keeping Whisper-compatible audio.
- Confirmed transcripts still live only in memory within `TranscriptStore` (`whisp_web_server.py:206-216`); logging or persistence remains opt-in so the UI resets cleanly unless we decide to write out history later.
